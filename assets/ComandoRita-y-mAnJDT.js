I designed a simple enclosure in Onshape, consisting of a 3D-printed frame that wraps around the plexiglass panel, with the LED strip running along the inner perimeter. The result is a soft, uniform glow that fills the room - dependant on the acrylic used. The light is powered by a 12V transformer and an ESP32-C3, the LEDs are controlled wirelessly via a web app using the Web Bluetooth API, allowing you to connect and change colors on the fly from a browser.
